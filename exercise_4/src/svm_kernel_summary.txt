SVM Kernel summary (simple conclusions based on GridSearch metrics):

Seeds dataset: best SVM params: {'svc__C': 10, 'svc__kernel': 'linear'}

Seeds SVM accuracy: 0.9245

Mushroom dataset: best SVM params: {'svc__C': 0.1, 'svc__kernel': 'linear'}

Mushroom SVM accuracy: 0.9985


Short notes on kernels (to include in repository README):
- linear: good for linearly separable data; simple; fewer hyperparams.
- rbf: flexible; maps to infinite-dim; often good default; gamma controls locality (large gamma -> more complex, risk overfit).
- poly: useful if polynomial relationships; degree controls complexity.
- sigmoid: rarely best; behaves like NN activation; use sparingly.
